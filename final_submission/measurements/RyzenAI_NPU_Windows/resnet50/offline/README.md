# MLPerf Inference - Open Division Submission

## Implementation ID
RyzenAI_ResNet50_Fp32

## Model
The model used is the torchvision pre-trained ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet-1K. It was exported to ONNX format using `torch.onnx.export`.

No weight transformation or quantization was applied.

## Preprocessing
Standard ImageNet preprocessing was applied:

- Resize to 256 pixels (shorter side)
- Center crop to 224x224
- Convert to tensor
- Normalize using ImageNet mean and std:
  - mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
  - std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]

## Postprocessing
The model outputs raw logits. Top-1 classification accuracy is computed using argmax over the output tensor.

## Calibration
Not applicable â€” the model is FP32 with no quantization.

## System and Software
- Hardware: AMD Ryzen AI NPU
- OS: Windows (via Jupyter Notebook)
- Frameworks:
  - PyTorch
  - TorchVision
  - ONNX Runtime (if used for inference)
- Environment:
  - Ryzen AI SDK version 1.4.0
  - Jupyter Lab using `ipykernel` 3 inside a Conda environment

## Custom Components
- A custom Python dataset class (`ImagenetDataset`) was used to load, cache, and preprocess images.
- The benchmark was executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment without access to a command-line terminal.

## Run Command
The benchmark was executed using a custom Python script that integrates MLPerf LoadGen with ONNX Runtime and dataset loader.

Example parameters used:
- Scenario: Offline
- Mode: Performance
- Batch size: 8
- Expected QPS: 5000
